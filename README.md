# Restaurants

Restaurants reviews application with accesibility and responsiveness in mind.

This is an exercise build for Udacity Senior Web Developer Nanodegree program. I will try to build a 
good, responsive and accessible user experience using HTML5, ES6 without any JS or Styling Framework.

## Install

To install and run the local server you have to run this commands:

    $> git clone https://github.com/juanmirod/restaurants
    $> npm install
    $> gulp serve

This last command should launch the browser and open the app at `localhost:3030/` Enjoy!

To serve minimized files use `gulp serve:dist` instead.
