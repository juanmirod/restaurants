## Requirements

The application must include restaurant names, a photograph, address and operating hours for each restaurant along with reviews, including the name of the reviewer, date of review, 5-star rating system, and comments. The application must include an application header, a menu providing multiple ways to filter the restaurants. When viewing a specific restaurant, current reviews must be displayed along with a form for the user to submit their own review.
